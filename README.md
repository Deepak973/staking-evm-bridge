# Project Definition:

## Secure Time-Based Staking & Reward System with EVM Bridge

### üöÄ Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, Wagmi Library, WalletConnect
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express.js)
- **Database:** MongoDB (Logging transactions)
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (Upgradable via Proxy)

## üìå Project Overview

This decentralized staking and cross-chain bridge system enables users to:

- Stake native assets & ERC-20 tokens for fixed durations.
- Claim additional rewards for staking stablecoins (e.g., USDT).
- Unstake early with a penalty or wait for auto-withdrawal.
- Transfer assets between EVM chains securely using Wagmi & WalletConnect.
- Log all source & destination chain transactions via smart contract events.
- Generate detailed reports for user transactions.

## ‚ö° Smart Contract Functionality (Solidity)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Staking Mechanism

- Users can stake base assets & ERC-20 tokens for fixed durations:  
  ‚úÖ **1 Month** | ‚úÖ **6 Months** | ‚úÖ **1 Year** | ‚úÖ **2 Years**
- Users staking **more than 6 months** become eligible for additional rewards.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Early Unstaking & Penalty

- Users can unstake early but will face a percentage-based penalty.
- The penalty amount is deducted and sent to the protocol treasury.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Auto Unstake & Payout

- The contract automatically unstakes funds once the staking period is over.
- The full amount is credited back to the user‚Äôs wallet.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Additional Rewards for Stablecoin Staking

- If staking duration is **more than 6 months**, users can claim additional rewards.
- Rewards must be **claimed manually** (not auto-distributed).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Chain Asset Bridge (EVM Networks)

- Users can transfer **native assets & tokens** between supported EVM chains.
- The bridge contract **locks/mints assets** and emits events for tracking.
- Event-driven logging ensures **secure cross-chain tracking**.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Upgradable Proxy Contract

- Implements a **proxy contract pattern** for future upgrades.
- New **admin-only withdrawal function** will be added in a future upgrade.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Ownership Control

- Implements **best practices** to secure funds against exploits.
- Ownership should be **transferable** for decentralized governance.
- **Admin-only fund withdrawal** function for protocol-controlled treasury.

## üîí Backend Security (Node.js)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Contract Event Listener Protection

- WebSocket listeners with **rate limits** to prevent event spamming.
- Validate event data **before processing transactions**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Input Validation & Data Sanitization

- Validate **wallet addresses, amounts, and stake durations**.
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent **NoSQL injection** in MongoDB.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Database Security (MongoDB)

- Enable **IP whitelisting** to restrict access to authorized servers only.
- Store **sensitive data encrypted** at rest (**AES-256 encryption**).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Logging & Monitoring

- Log **all transactions, failed attempts, and suspicious activities**.
- Use **Winston/Bunyan** logging and enable **real-time monitoring**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Fund Withdrawal Mechanism

- **Multi-signature admin-controlled** withdrawals.
- Implement **timelocks** to prevent unauthorized access.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling & Exception Management

- Implement **global error handling middleware**.
- No **sensitive data leaks** in error responses.

## üîê Frontend Security (Next.js + Wagmi)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Wallet Authentication & Protection

- Secure wallet authentication using **WalletConnect & Wagmi Library**.
- Use **challenge-response authentication** for verifying wallets.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Prevent Frontend Data Tampering

- **Revalidate all staking/unstaking requests** on the backend.
- Implement **signed transactions** before submitting actions.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ CSRF & XSS Protection

- Use **CSRF tokens** for API routes to prevent CSRF attacks.
- Implement **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to block XSS attempts.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Session & Local Storage Security

- Do **not store private keys/sensitive user data** in localStorage.
- Use **secure cookies** (`httpOnly`, `sameSite`, `secure`).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Rate Limiting on User Actions

- **Limit staking & unstaking attempts** to prevent abuse.
- Implement **loading states** to prevent multiple submissions.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Secure API Calls

- Use **HTTPS with TLS 1.2+** for secure backend communication.
- **JWT verification** before processing user actions.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Prevent Phishing Attacks

- Show **human-readable transaction details** before signing.
- Warn users about **phishing risks** before transactions.
